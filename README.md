# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data to derive insights on the impact of vaccinations and other factors on the spread of the virus. The analysis includes various SQL queries to extract relevant data from a COVID-19 dataset, focusing on vaccination rates, case statistics, and demographic factors across different countries.

## Features
- Analysis of vaccination rates relative to new cases and deaths.
- Identification of trends in COVID-19 cases pre- and post-vaccination.
- Evaluation of countries based on demographic factors like GDP and life expectancy.
- Calculation of rolling averages for new cases.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For data querying and analysis.
- **Excel**: For initial data manipulation and preparation.

## Problem Statements
List of Some Problem Statements that are included in this project:
1. Which countries have reduced their daily new cases by more than 50% after reaching a 60% vaccination rate?
2. Find the countries where the GDP per capita is above $50,000 and the vaccination rate is over 70%
3. Find the total number of new cases reported worldwide during the first 6 months of the pandemic.
