# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 data to derive insights on the impact of vaccinations and other factors on the spread of the virus. The analysis includes various SQL queries to extract relevant data from a COVID-19 dataset, focusing on vaccination rates, case statistics, and demographic factors across different countries.

## Features
- Analysis of vaccination rates relative to new cases and deaths.
- Identification of trends in COVID-19 cases pre- and post-vaccination.
- Evaluation of countries based on demographic factors like GDP and life expectancy.
- Calculation of rolling averages for new cases.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For data querying and analysis.
- **Excel**: For initial data manipulation and preparation.

## SQL Queries
The following SQL queries are included in this project:
1. Query to find countries with a high number of new cases post-vaccination.
2. Correlation analysis between total vaccinations and total deaths.
3. Identification of countries with significant changes in case numbers after reaching vaccination milestones.

## Feedback

I welcome your contributions, suggestions, and insights with open heart! All feedback is appreciated.
